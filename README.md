### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *Yue Gao* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: Topic & Sentimental Analysis in Inaugural Address
+ This project is conducted by [Yue Gao]

+ Project summary: [a short summary] In this project, I analyzed the frequencies of each president mentioning some main topics ( economy, employment, education, national security, geopolitics, production ) and investigated the cooccurence of these topics. I also conducted a sentimental analysis for each president using Wordstat sentimental dictionary. Finally, I used these dimensional vectors ( frequencies of 6 topics and different emotions ) of presidents in the k-mean clustering and got an interesting result. I have also conducted a similarity analysis on Trump’s speech & Hillary’s speech versus some recent presidents.
